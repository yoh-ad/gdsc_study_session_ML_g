    "Machine Learning Problem Outline\n",
    "1️Identify an ML Problem\n",
    "Predicting the amount of electricity my home will use tomorrow based on past usage patterns.\n",
    "2️Classify the ML Type\n",
    "This is a Supervised Learning problem.\n",
    "We already have historical data showing the electricity used each day (input) and the actual usage values (labels).\n",
    "The model learns the relationship between past patterns and future consumption.\n",
    "3️ Outline the ML Workflow\n",
    "• Collect Data: Gather daily electricity usage for the past months or years.\n",
    "• Preprocess Data: Clean missing values, remove outliers, and scale features.\n",
    "• Feature Engineering: Extract useful features such as day of week, weather, temperature, or time of year.\n",
    "• Split Data: Divide data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "• Train Model: Use a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to learn patterns.\n",
    "• Evaluate Model: Test accuracy using metrics like MAE or RMSE.\n",
    "• Deploy Model: Use the trained model to predict future electricity usage.\n",
    "• Monitor & Update: Regularly retrain the model when new data comes in.\n",
    "4️ One Possible Failure Point + Fix\n",
    "Failure Point: Bad / insufficient data.\n",
    "If the dataset has too few samples or missing days, the model will learn weak patterns and produce inaccurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix: Collect more historical usage data, fill missing values using interpolation methods, and include additional useful data such as weather information to strengthen the model’s learning. Regularly update the dataset to improve accuracy over time.\n"
